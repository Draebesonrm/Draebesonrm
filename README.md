- I will be 100% honest as I'm sure it's painfully obvious but I am very new to all of this.
- I've got started later than most, I know I'm aging myself here but when I was young MsDOS was just being replaced by Win95 lol

- I really hope that I make some friends on here, or at least learn something.
